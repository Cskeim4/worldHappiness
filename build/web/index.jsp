                        The World Happiness Report is a landmark survey of the state of global happiness.
                        The first report was published in 2012, the second in 2013, the third in 2015, and
                        the fourth in the 2016 Update. The World Happiness 2017, which ranks 155 countries
                        by their happiness levels, was released at the United Nations at an event celebrating
                        International Day of Happiness on March 20th. The report continues to gain global
                        recognition as governments, organizations and civil society increasingly use 
                        happiness indicators to inform their policy-making decisions. Leading experts across
                        fields - economics, psychology, survey analysis, national statistics, health, public
                        policy and more - describe how measurements of well-being can be used effectively to
                        assess the progress of nations. The reports review the state of happiness in the world
                        today and show how the new science of happiness explains personal and national variations in happiness.
